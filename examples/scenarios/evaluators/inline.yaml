name: Inline Custom Matcher Examples
description: |
  Demonstrates the inline evaluator for custom expression-based matching.
  Use for complex validation logic without writing custom evaluator code.

  Supported expressions:
  - length > N, length < N, length == N, length >= N, length <= N
  - startsWith("prefix"), endsWith("suffix")
  - includes("substring"), !includes("substring")
  - matches(/regex/flags)
  - json.field == value, json.field.nested == value
  - Combined with && (and) and || (or)

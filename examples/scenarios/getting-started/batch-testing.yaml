# batch-testing.yaml
# ===================
# Example demonstrating batch/parallel scenario testing.
# Use this as one of several scenarios to test the parallel run feature.
#
# Run multiple scenarios in parallel:
#   artemiskit run examples/scenarios/getting-started/ --parallel 3
#
# Run with glob pattern:
#   artemiskit run 'examples/scenarios/getting-started/*.yaml' --parallel 2
#
# The --parallel flag specifies how many scenarios run concurrently.
# This is useful for:
# - Faster test execution with many scenarios
# - CI/CD pipelines with time constraints
# - Testing multiple aspects of your LLM simultaneously

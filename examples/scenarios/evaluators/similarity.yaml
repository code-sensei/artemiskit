name: Similarity Evaluator Examples
description: |
  Demonstrates the similarity evaluator for semantic matching using embeddings or LLM.

  Modes:
  - embedding: Uses vector embeddings for fast, cost-effective semantic comparison
  - llm: Uses LLM to evaluate semantic similarity (slower but more nuanced)
  - (default): Auto-selects based on availability (prefers embedding)

  When using embedding mode, you can specify an embeddingModel.
  When using llm mode, you can specify a model for comparison.

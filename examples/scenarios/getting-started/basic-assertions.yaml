description: Examples of all expectation types

cases:
  # ---- Contains Expectation ----
  # Checks if the response contains specific strings
  - id: contains-any
    name: Contains (any mode)
    prompt: "What is 2 + 2?"
    expected:
      type: contains
      values:
        - "4"
        - "four"
      mode: any # Pass if ANY value is found

  - id: contains-all
    name: Contains (all mode)
    prompt: "Name three primary colors"
    expected:
      type: contains
      values:
        - "red"
        - "blue"
      mode: all # Pass if ALL values are found

  # ---- Regex Expectation ----
  # Matches response against a regular expression pattern
  - id: regex-pattern
    name: Regex pattern matching
    prompt: "What is today's date format in ISO 8601?"
    expected:
      type: regex
      pattern: "\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}" # Matches YYYY-MM-DD
      flags: "i" # Case insensitive

  # ---- Exact Expectation ----
  # Response must exactly match the expected value
  - id: exact-match
    name: Exact match
    prompt: "Reply with exactly the word 'OK' and nothing else"
    expected:
      type: exact
      value: "OK"
      caseSensitive: false

  # ---- Fuzzy Expectation ----
  # Uses string similarity matching
  - id: fuzzy-match
    name: Fuzzy similarity
    prompt: "What color is grass?"
    expected:
      type: fuzzy
      value: "green"
      threshold: 0.7 # 70% similarity required

  # ---- LLM Grader Expectation ----
  # Uses another LLM to evaluate the response
  - id: llm-graded
    name: LLM-based grading
    prompt: "Write a haiku about programming"
    expected:
      type: llm_grader
      rubric: |
        Score 1.0 if the response is a valid haiku (5-7-5 syllables) about programming.
        Score 0.5 if it's about programming but not proper haiku format.
        Score 0.0 if it's neither a haiku nor about programming.
      threshold: 0.7
